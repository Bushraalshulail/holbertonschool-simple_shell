# Simple Shell

A lightweight, custom-built UNIX command-line interpreter written in C.  
It replicates fundamental shell behavior including command parsing, execution, environment handling, and support for built-in commands.

---

## Features

- Custom shell prompt (`($)`)
- Command execution using `execve`
- PATH resolution for locating executables
- Built-in commands: `exit`, `env`
- Handles End-Of-File (Ctrl+D)
- Supports both **interactive** and **non-interactive** modes
